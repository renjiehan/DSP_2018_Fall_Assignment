To solve this assignment, HKT is required.


After applying Gaussian mixture, iterate 20 times instead of 5 times to get new mean and standard deviation.

Then I increase state number from 5 to 13(edit lib/proto), the accuracy exceed 96% by now.

At last, revise MU parameter in lib/mix2_10.hed from 2 to 6 (MU of silence from 3 to 6).
By now, the accuracy is 97.58%.
